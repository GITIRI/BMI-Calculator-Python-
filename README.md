# BMI CALCULATOR

Inspired by [Alex The Analyst's project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey1VNjU0YbM) [based on the Mercer Health BMI Calculator](https://mercer-health.com/services/weight-management-center/bmi-calculator#:~:text=Body%20Mass%20Index%2C%20or%20BMI,inches%20x%20height%20in%20inches)

I made this BMI calculator after watching [Alex The Analyst's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey1VNjU0YbM) and went a step ahead to design a GUI using tkinter library.

The project makes use of Python functions, Loops and Tkinter message box to calculate the BMI of a person based on their input (height & weight) and then displays the user's name, their BMI and a corresponding message on their weight and health risk.

I really enjoyed working on this.
